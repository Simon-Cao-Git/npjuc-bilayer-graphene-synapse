## Figure 2c

Total energy comparison of a Li atom placed in three distinct configurations: (i) intercalated between the graphene layers (reference, 0 eV), (ii) adsorbed on the outer surface of the top graphene layer (0.682 eV higher), and (iii) positioned far above the bilayer in vacuum (1.874 eV higher). These results indicate a strong thermodynamic preference for Li to occupy the interlayer space.

Results for (i), (ii), and (iii) are provided in their respective subdirectories.

## Methods Overview  

- Calculation types are single-point energies
- All 3 cases are minimized with a force threshold of 0.01 eV/Å
