## Figure 5b,c

These figures compare the relative total energies of a Li atom placed at varying distances (5 Å, 3 Å, 1 Å) from hydrogen-terminated edges in nanoribbon models with armchair (b) and zigzag (c) terminations. In both cases, the intercalated configuration is used as the reference (0 eV), and Li is increasingly stabilized as it approaches the edge. Relative energies are listed below.

- **Armchair edge (b):**  
  - 5 Å: 1.838 eV  
  - 3 Å: 1.728 eV  
  - 1 Å: 1.564 eV  
  - inside: 0 eV  

- **Zigzag edge (c):**  
  - 5 Å: 2.399 eV  
  - 3 Å: 2.321 eV  
  - 1 Å: 2.088 eV  
  - inside: 0 eV  

Within the **b** and **c** subdirectories for armchair edge and zigzag edge, results for 1 Å, 3 Å, 5 Å, and inside-edge configurations are provided in their respective subfolders.

## Methods Overview  

- Calculation types are single-point energies.
- The inside-edge cases are minimized with a force threshold of 0.01 eV/Å.
- The 1 Å, 3 Å, 5 Å cases are single point calculations without minimization, as minimization will bring the Li into the edge.
