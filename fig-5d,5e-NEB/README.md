## Figure 5d,e

CI-NEB calculations showing energy barrier and insertion path of Li from 5 Å outside the edge into the bilayer graphene structure for armchair (d) and zigzag (e) edges. The inset illustrates the atomic trajectory along the insertion pathway. Both cases show negligible energy barriers, indicating that edge-driven intercalation is favorable.

- The results from **5 Å outside the edge** case from **5b,c** is reused as the first image of the NEB runs. 
- The results from **inside the edge** case from **5b,c** is reused as the last image of the NEB runs.  

Within the **d** and **e** subdirectories for armchair edge and zigzag edge respectively:
  - **00** and **15** correspond to the first and last images.  
  - You should be able to find out the detailed calculation logs for the middile images from **01–14**, including initial guess pathway(from POSCARs).
