## Figure 5d,e

These figures show results from CI-NEB calculations showing energy barrier and insertion path of Li entering from 5 Å outside the edge into the bilayer graphene structure for armchair (d) and zigzag (e) edges. Both cases show negligible energy barriers, indicating that edge-driven intercalation is favorable.

- The single point results from **5 Å outside the edge** case from **5b,c** is reused as the first image of the NEB runs. 
- The single point results from **inside the edge** case from **5b,c** is reused as the last image of the NEB runs.  

Within the **d** and **e** subdirectories for armchair edge and zigzag edge respectively:
  - **00** and **15** correspond to the first and last images.  
  - You should be able to find out the detailed calculation logs for the middile images from **01–14**, including initial guess pathway(from POSCARs).
