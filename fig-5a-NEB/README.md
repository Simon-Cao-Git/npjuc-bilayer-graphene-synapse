## Figure 5a

This figure shows results from a CI-NEB calculation, showing energy barrier and insertion path of Li insertion through a single-carbon (1C) vacancy in the top layer of a bilayer graphene structure, giving a high energy barrier of approximately 2.7 eV.

- **1st-img-single-point**: Contains the minimization for the first image of the NEB run.  
- **last-img-single-point**: Contains the minimization for the last image of the NEB run.  
- **NEB**: Contains the NEB calculation results.  
  - **00** and **06** correspond to the first and last images mentioned above.  
  - You should be able to find out the detailed calculation logs for the middile images from **01–05**, including initial guess pathway(from POSCARs).

## Methods Overview  

- Calculation type is CI(climbing image)-NEB.
- A total of 5 images are used.
- NEB force threshold is set to 0.03 eV/Å.
